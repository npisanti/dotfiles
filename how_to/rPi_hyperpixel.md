before installing the hyperpixel make a copy of the config.txt
```console
    sudo cp /boot/config.txt /boot/hdmi-config.txt
```

after installing the hyperpixel make a copy of the config.txt
```console
    sudo cp /boot/config.txt /boot/hyper-config.txt
```

now you can choose before booting up by copying `hdmi-config.txt` or `hyper-config.txt` over `config.txt`
