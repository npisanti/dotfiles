function passed by value / reference


scopes with ::


It's crucial that you remember the semicolon at the end of a C++ class declaration. Failure to include the semicolon will cause a compile-time error, but not at the end of the class declaration. Often the error will be reported in a perfectly viable file, such as in a header file that you included.


everytime you use `new` you also have to `delete` somewhere (also constructor / destructors)


public / private / protected


the symbol NULL is actually an int! This has brought down many a great C++ programmer. The workaround is to explicitly cast NULL to the pointer type you want.

pointers 

& * operators

nella dichiarzione 
* = puntatore a 
& = riferimento a

come operatori
* = contenuto dell'indirizzo        *pNumber
& = l'indirizzo di                  &number 

nelle funzioni 
* = come dichiarazione
& = la variabile Ã¨ passata per riferimento


NULL o nullptr
