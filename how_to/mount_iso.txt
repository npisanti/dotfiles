This is the traditional way for those who like using the command line interface. Fast and easy. Just open a terminal or konsole and type:

su -
mkdir ~/temp
mount -o loop -t iso9660 /path/to/test.iso ~/temp

Now the iso files will be stored in the ~/temp dir. Just remember to change /path/to/test.iso to where you have the .iso file and ~/temp to the directory you want to have it mounted.

To unmount the cd/dvd image type:

su -
umount ~/temp

Note: Ubuntu users should use sudo before the commands. su - command isn't needed in this case.
