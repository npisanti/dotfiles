--------figuring out the interface name--------

		Type 
	iwconfig
		You will see a list of interfaces. Ignore all the interfaces that say "no wireless extensions".

		The interface name will be wlan0, wlan2 or ath0 or something like that.

		This document uses the name wlan0 but you should substitute wlan0 for whichever interface your system reports.



--------adding passwords--------

	$ sudo su
	# wpa_passphrase SSID PASSPHRASE >> /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf
		Make sure to use >> and not > or else you will delete all your wireless passwords! It's a good idea to make a backup occasionally:

sudo cp /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf{,.backup}



--------run wpa_supplicant--------
--------scanning for access points--------

	$ sudo iw dev wlan0 scan | grep SSID
	    SSID: MEO-876078
	    SSID: Thomson249040
	    SSID: MEO-089464
	    SSID: Solmar - Guests
	    SSID: SINDICADO-NACIONAL
	    SSID: Solmar



--------connecting to an access point--------

		To connect to an access point called SSID, do:

	$ sudo iw dev wlan0 connect -w SSID

		see if you're connected to an access point

		Use iwconfig:

	$ iwconfig wlan0

		When you're connected, you will see something like:

	wlan0     IEEE 802.11abgn  ESSID:"Thomson249040"  
	          Mode:Managed  Frequency:2.412 GHz  Access Point: 00:24:17:44:35:28   
	          Bit Rate=48 Mb/s   Tx-Power=19 dBm   
	          Retry limit:231   RTS thr:off   Fragment thr:off
	          Power Management:off
	          Link Quality=46/70  Signal level=-64 dBm  
	          Rx invalid nwid:0  Rx invalid crypt:0  Rx invalid frag:0
	          Tx excessive retries:170  Invalid misc:134   Missed beacon:0
	getting an IP address

		Most of the time you'll just need to do:

	sudo dhclient wlan0
		but sometimes you will get the message:

	RTNETLINK answers: File exists
		In that case, release the dhcp lease first with -r and then get a lease:

	$ sudo dhclient -r wlan0
	$ sudo dhclient wlan0
		Once dhclient finishes, you're online!



--------disconnecting--------

	sudo iw dev wlan0 disconnect
