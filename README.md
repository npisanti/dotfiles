==============
This is basically a dotfile repo, a collection of files to set up my usual working enviroment, a collection of scripts that i keep in my `~/bin` and also a collection of how tos to write down things i usually forget. 
   
In a folder there is also included a build of the [Equilux theme](https://github.com/ddnexus/equilux-theme).   

The setup scripts are still alpha so DO NOT USE, just pick the confs you like.   

Here is an example of the desktop, i mostly use 1px pixelperfect lines, click for fullscreen, illustration by [Max Prentis](http://maxprentisvisual.tumblr.com/).
